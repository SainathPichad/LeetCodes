// You are given a string array words and a string s, where words[i] and s comprise only of lowercase English letters.

// Return the number of strings in words that are a prefix of s.

// A prefix of a string is a substring that occurs at the beginning of the string. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: words = ["a","b","c","ab","bc","abc"], s = "abc"
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
// The strings in words which are a prefix of s = "abc" are:
// "a", "ab", and "abc".
// Thus the number of strings in words which are a prefix of s is 3.



class Solution {
    public int countPrefixes(String[] words, String s) {
        int c=0;
        for(String s1:words){
            if(s.indexOf(s1)==0){
                c++;
            }
        }
        return c;
    }
